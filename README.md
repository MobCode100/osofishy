# OSOFISHY: Open Source File Sharing System

Started as someone's final year project, this project is an open source file sharing system using the Laravel framework that includes the implementation of Peer-to-peer (P2P) technology through WebRTC as one of its features. OSOFISHY is a software licensed under the [GNU GPLv3 license](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html).

The project is still in very early stages of development, so there's no interesting stuff here yet.
